 <h2>Hello, my name is Brittany Taylor.  I am currenlty a student of the University of the West Indies.
    <br>My hobbies include listening to music, watching TV shows. My favorite Tv shows to watch are those either written or produce by Shonda Rhimes</br>
    <br> I also really enjoy watching and playing basketball, even though I'm very unatheletic.</br>
    <br> I am interesting in Web Development because I would like to have an understanding of the designs behind websites that I use daily.</br>
